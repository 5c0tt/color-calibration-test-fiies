# Target Test Forms
This is a file supplied by 3m that was used in calibration in an era just after the dinosaurs.  For a few hundred thousand dollars you could buy printers, scanners, and other magical machines that spit out film, were rinsed in caustic chemicals just like old school photo-chemicals.

In the end, you have a proof, and it should match your screen to what you are holding in your hand.  No match, use the tools in your application to adjust the display to match the print.  The print is called a MatchPrint.

Once you have a match, no matter how terrible it looks, you are now baseline. Adjust your image on screen, and the next match print should match.

This usually works if your chemistry is new and the right temperature all the time, and you use high quality film that is linear in how it deviates from what it is supposed to be.

We were able to hold a 1% dot well, which is pretty amazing.
